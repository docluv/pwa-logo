A Logo to Represent Progressive Web Applications


# What Are Progressive Web Applications?

Progressive Web Applications, or PWAs, combine a mix of modern web technologies to create a rich user experience leveraging cross-platform web standards. The term Progressive Web Application was created by the Google Chrome team to describe web sites and applications that meet the minimum PWA criteria.

# What is the Minimum PWA Criteria?

This is an evolving definition, but at a minimum a site must implement HTTPS, [a web manifest](https://github.com/w3c/manifest) and a Service Worker.

# PWA Advantages

- Ability to 'install' or add to the home screen and launch without browser chrome visible. This makes the application very 'app like'.

# The PWA Logo

The logo was created by Love2Dev because there was not an icon or logo representing the concept of a PWA. The logo should be considered publically available for everyone to use.
